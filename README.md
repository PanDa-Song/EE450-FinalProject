# EE450 Final Project
-- USC Healthcenter Covid-19 testing application


## Project Description 

This project is to simulate a covid-19 tesing application process. This process involves the USC students who apply for covid-19 virus testing, the USC Health Center that manages the testing, and the different hospitals that will provide students the chances to get the test. The communication among the USC students, health center and hospitals are performed over TCP and UDP sockets in a network with a client-server architecture.

The project has 2 major phases: 1) Hospitals provide the USC health center, the list of available departments that could do the testing process, 2) Students apply to the USC center to have the chance of getting tested. The USC health center makes the decision and sends the results to both students and hospitals. In phase 1 all communications are through TCP sockets.

## Compilation Steps

- g++ -o Healthcenter Healthcenter.cpp
- g++ -o Hospital Hospital.cpp
- g++ -o Student Student.cpp


## Running Steps

- Terminal 1:

    `$./Healthcenter`
    
- Terminal 2: 

    `$./Hospital`

- Wait utill on healthcenter scree, it says `End of Phase 1 for the health center`

- Terminal3:

    `$./Student`

## Expected Output

- For Hospital information received in phase I, I firstly store them in a txt file **hosp_info.txt** during TCP in each child process.
- For Student application information, I firstly store them in a txt file **student#_info**(# is the number of student) for each student so there are totally 5 files for student.
- After all TCP connection close, the Healthcenter transfer information in these txt files to array and vector.
- For UDP part, the Healthcenter check the feasibility for each student and sent reply to student. 
- Then check again and send information to hospitals.
